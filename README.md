# Blockchain Based File Sharing System

This project is a secure and decentralized file sharing application that combines AES encryption, IPFS for distributed file storage, Supabase for user authentication, and simulated blockchain-based metadata management. Users can upload, encrypt, share, and receive files while ensuring confidentiality, verifiability, and tamper-resistance.

Key Features

🔒 AES Encryption: Files are encrypted before upload to protect data confidentiality.

🌐 IPFS Storage: Files are stored in a decentralized network to prevent single points of failure.

✅ Simulated Blockchain Metadata: File metadata and transfer history are securely recorded in a backend database (e.g., Supabase), simulating blockchain immutability and transparency.

🔑 User Authentication: Supabase handles secure user sign-up and login.

📁 User-Friendly Interface: Simple dashboard to send, receive, and track files securely.

Purpose
To provide a user-friendly, privacy-focused file sharing solution that overcomes limitations of centralized storage by combining cryptography and blockchain principles.

Future Work
Future versions aim to integrate with real blockchain networks such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric to provide truly decentralized and immutable metadata tracking.
